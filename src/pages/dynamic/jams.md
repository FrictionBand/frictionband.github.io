# Join Our Monthly Jam Sessions at Cable Factory!

Every first Friday of the month, dive into the pulsating rhythms of Cumbia and the electrifying beats of Afrobeat at the iconic Cable Factory in Helsinki. Our evening kicks off at 18:00 with a dynamic 30-minute set performed by our talented collective, setting the stage for what’s to come.
