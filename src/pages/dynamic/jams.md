# Join Our Monthly Jam Sessions at Cable Factory!

Every first Friday of the month, dive into the pulsating rhythms of Cumbia and the electrifying beats of Afrobeat at the iconic Cable Factory in Helsinki. Our evening kicks off at 17:30 setting the stage for what’s to come.

After our performance, the stage opens up to all until 19:00. Whether you’re a musician eager to share your skills, or simply a music lover wanting to enjoy live, spontaneous performances, our jam sessions are the perfect place to connect and create unforgettable musical experiences.

Come feel the groove of our community-driven gatherings and help us turn every session into a celebration of music and culture. No matter your experience level, bring your instrument, your passion, and your friends to the Cable Factory and be a part of something truly special. See you there.
