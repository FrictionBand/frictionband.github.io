We continue our ongoing residency and open jam session at [Kahvibaari in Kaapelitehdas](https://www.kaapelitehdas.fi/en/performances) (Cable Factory, Helsinki). Every first Friday of the month Friction Groove Collective performs a short showcase concert, before opening the stage to invite players of all ages and skill level to join us for an easy-going open stage jam session primarily focused on groove based music, jazz, latin and afrobeat. Entry is free and happy hour prices apply at the bar. The next jam is on the 7th, November, 2025; between 17:30-20:00. Welcome!
