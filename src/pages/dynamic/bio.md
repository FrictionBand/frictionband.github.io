# About Friction

The Helsinki based Friction Groove Collective has been performing in Finland's capital region for the better part of a decade, playing primarily an afrobeat, jazz, and latin cumbia influenced repertoire, with occasional added Near Eastern and North African flavours.

It’s safe to say that the name Friction is more than a little tongue in cheek, as the group is a dynamically evolving collective made up of passionate musicians, harmoniously blending diverse genres and cultural backgrounds. With over a dozen musicians often contributing to their live performances, Friction has an expansive and layered sound, with a rich horn section, a multilayered percussion section, wide ranging electric guitar textures, and catchy basslines. There’s a lot going on but it’s all firmly rooted in a range of infectious grooves from around the world.
