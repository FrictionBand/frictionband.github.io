# Join Our Monthly Jam Sessions at Cable Factory!

Join us every first Friday at the Cable Factory in Helsinki for a jam session, playing Cumbia, Afrobeat, Jazz, Groove or whatever else is on your mind. We get started at 17:30, warming up and opening the stage until 20:00. Whether you wanna come play an instrument, sing or perhaps just sit back with a drink and our jam sessions are a great place for meeting like-minded music lovers.

Feel the energy of the community and help make each session a proper celebration of music and culture. Whatever your skill level, grab your instrument, bring your mates, and head down to the Cable Factory for something genuinely special. Hope to see you there!

Next dates: 11.07.2025, we'll continue every first Friday of the month!
