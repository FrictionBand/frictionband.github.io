The multi-generational city festival organized in Lapinlahti the previous two years will in the future be a music event that repeats once a month, which takes place from August to November always on the last Saturday of the month at Lapinlahti L채hti.

The event offers a stage for RockHubs neighborhood bands who are enthusiastic about the music hobby and connect generations. In addition, there are invited artist guests at the events. The event days also combine music workshops and a discussion about the importance of culture for well-being.

The events are free of charge and their organization is supported by the city of Helsinki.

Welcome to meet and make music with a low threshold during the fall!
