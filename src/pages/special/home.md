## Friction is back at Kekri Festival on Suomenlinna on 2.11.2024

We are honored to once again be part of the amazing Viaporin Kekri Festival this year!

<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Kekri is an ancient Finnish celebration at the end of the harvest season and the cycle of the year. Kekri is celebrated with plenty of food and drink, honoring the dead and giving thanks for the harvest and the past year. In Viaporâ€™s kekri, based on old traditions, a common urban event suitable for this time has been created for the residents of Suomenlinna, the people of Helsinki and those who visit the beloved UNESCO World Heritage Site of Suomenlinna. Viaporiâ€™s kekri is an event full of light and Suomenlinna art, culture and flavors.</em></p>

You can find more information about the event here: [https://www.suomenlinna.fi/en/en-viaporin-kekri-2024/](https://www.suomenlinna.fi/en/en-viaporin-kekri-2024/). We will once again play in the ancient **Tenalji von Fersen** hall in the **beer festival** part of the event where local breweries showcase their latest produce. Entrance is free, and we will play 3 sets, likely ~16:00, ~18:00 and ~20:00.

We had a lot of fun last year:
